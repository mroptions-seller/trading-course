        Hello, My name is Major Singh. I am a 28-year-old entrepreneur,
        Professional Stock Market Trader and a YouTuber. I am here to share my
        best years of experience in the Stock Market.

        I started trading for the first time when I was 25 years old, but due to
        a lack of knowledge I have lost my fund but that was not over and after
        various rounds & years of trial and error with learning, I found my
        trading edge..

        In this program, I share all my proprietary methods and the tools that I
        use. I have spent tons of money & endless late nights behind  developing
        a profitable strategy for myself , and I’m giving it all in this
        program.

      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        From my experience, the primary reason for why we trade is that, when
        done right, it can make you BIG MONEY.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        That’s why you are here, and that is why I have put so much effort into
        creating these platform.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        My main goal is you to become a successful Trader.

      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        Enjoy trading!
